# my_movie_api

Edgar's first live Movie API for his personal use and for other similar movie aficionados.

This app displays data about movies, similar to IMDB, such as: 
1) Titles, 
2) Directors, 
3) Actors, 
4) Genre, 
5) Release date. 

## Backend

App was built using multiple popular backend tools such as: 
* Express,
* BodyParser,
* Mongoose,
* MongoDB,
* Models.js, and
* Passport.js.   

Users login to app using JSON authentication which creates JWT Tokens to ensure only valid registered users can access and use the database. 

The Movie API is composed by the following components: 
* A simple Node.js API using Express deployed on Render;
* A MongoDB database.
