MyFlix is a server-side web application that will provide users with access to information for different movies (directors, genres, actors, etc.). Users will be able to sign-up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

Server-side includes the server, business logic, and business layers of the application.  This will consist of a well-designed REST API and architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB. The REST API will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from the database and sotre that data in a non-relational way.
